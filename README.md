# Flight-Booking-app

Built with C#, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript using ASP.NET Core and Angular, allows the user to create an account and book a flight from the available flights. 
There is also a 'my bookings' page that allows the user to see all the bookings they have made with the ability to cancel any booking they want.
The app has a repository layer, and I am using DTOs to pass data to the client.
Data is stored in an in-memory SQL database.
